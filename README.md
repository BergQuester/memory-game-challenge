# memory-game-challenge

I have done a couple of SpriteKit related tutorials in the past, but I haven't done anything on my own. This matching game represents my first attempt at doing a SpriteKit game on my own and represents several hours of learning while coding it. As such, I'm sure there are many breaks from SpriteKit best-practices.

## Tests

There is plentiful test coverage on the models and related logic. Given the exploratory nature of this project, there isn't any tests for the game logic or UI at this time.

## Known issues

* The card layout could use some more polish on smaller screens
